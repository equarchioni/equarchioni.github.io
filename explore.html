                <p>These famous animals lived between about 250 and 66 million years ago. They lived longer than our species Homosapiens so far.Dinosaurs are prehistoric reptiles such as crocodiles and lizards, but we can differentiate them based on their leg positions on the ground. Lizards have bones almost parallel to the ground or sprawling feature, dinosaurs on the other hand have an upright stance or legs perpendicular to their body.</p>

            <h2 class="topic-2"><em>Non-Avaian Dinosaurs vs. Avain Dinosaurs</em></h2>
            <img src="Images/velociraptors_by_risachantag_d8xivy0-fullview.jpg" class="image2">
                <p>Birds are one kind of dinosaur because they share a common ancestor with non-avian dinosaurs. Non-avian dinosaurs are all dinosaurs besides birds and they are already extinct. It is not known why avian dinosaurs survived compared to their relatives, but scientist suggest this was casued by their flexible diet and size.</p>
                <p>Through fossil evidence, scientists discovered that avian dinosaurs were more bird-like. Their fossils showed evidence of feathers as well as hollow bones compared to the denser bones of their non-avian ancestors. Also, avian dinosaurs are considered warm-blooded creatures, and non-avian dinosaurs are cold-blooded, however, this is still up for debate.</p>

            <h2 class="topic-3"><em>Why Does it Matter?</em></h2>
            <img src="Images/dcxd9nm-ca02bba5-6e26-41c9-99a0-8279138423bf.png" class="image3">
                <p>By understanding the differences between avian and non-avian dinosaurs, we can trace their evolution to a common bird the chicken! In fact, the chicken has more in common with the T-rex compared to the alligator. We can see this evidence through the use of a<a href="tree.html">Phylogenetic Tree</a>.</p>
                <p>Birds belong to the theropod group of dinosaurs, which also includes famous dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex and Velociraptor. Theropods were bipedal (walked on two legs) and had certain bird-like features. Discovered in 1861, Archaeopteryx is the earliest known bird-like dinosaur.It lived during the Late Jurassic era (around 150 million years ago).Archaeopteryx had both reptilian and bird-like characteristics, including feathers.</p>
                <p>Fossil evidence shows that many dinosaurs had distinctive bird-like feathers. These feathers were not just for insulation; they likely played a role in flight and other behaviors. The Late Jurassic era is when we find more bird-like dinosaurs. Fossils from China, such as Anchiornis, reveal winged dinosaurs with large feather arrays on their legs. These discoveries suggest that birds evolved from a gliding ancestor that had effectively four wings.</p>
                <p>In summary, birds are not just related to dinosaurs; they are dinosaurs, the living descendants of ancient reptilian creatures that once roamed the Earth!</p>
